# Memento

AI infrastructure for cloud-native organisations. Built for the messy middle between hobbyist tools and enterprise bloat.

## What we're building

Most AI tooling assumes you're either tinkering in a notebook or you're Google. We're building for everyone else: startups scaling fast, scaleups hitting complexity walls, enterprises trying to modernise without the usual consultancy nonsense.

If you're running production workloads in the cloud and the existing AI solutions don't quite fit, we're building something you'll actually remember using.

## Who this is for

**Platform engineers** dealing with the reality of multi-cloud deployments and wondering why AI tooling ignores half your stack.

**CTOs and technical leaders** tired of choosing between tools that don't scale and enterprise solutions that take six months to deploy.

**Engineering teams** who need AI infrastructure that works with Kubernetes, understands GitOps, and doesn't assume you've got unlimited budget or infinite patience.

## Current status

We're in the early stages. Building in the open where it makes sense, keeping quiet about the bits that don't. If you're interested in what we're doing, watch this space.

*Memento mori for the startup age. Build things worth remembering.*
