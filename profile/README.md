# Memento

We build AI products for engineering teams. Agentic developer portals, intelligent platforms, and the infrastructure to run them at scale.

For startups scaling fast, scaleups hitting complexity walls, enterprises modernising without consultancy bloat.

## What we're building

**AI-powered engineering platforms** - Agentic developer portals, intelligent CI/CD, automated operations

**Production AI infrastructure** - GPU clusters, model serving, cost optimisation, observability

Built for the messy middle. Not hobbyist tools, not enterprise overkill.

## Current status

Early stages. Building in the open where it makes sense. If you're interested, watch this space.

*Memento mori for the startup age. Build things worth remembering.*
